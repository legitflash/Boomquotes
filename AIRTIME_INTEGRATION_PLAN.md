# Airtime Rewards Integration Plan

## Current Status
- Reloadly API registration requires business email/domain
- App not yet deployed to get custom domain
- Rewards system UI is built and functional

## Alternative Options

### Option 1: Deploy First, Then Integrate (Recommended)
1. Deploy app to Vercel to get production domain (yourapp.vercel.app)
2. Use production domain to create business email (admin@yourapp.vercel.app)
3. Register for Reloadly API with business credentials
4. Integrate real airtime rewards after deployment

### Option 2: Alternative Airtime Providers
- **Ding API**: Global airtime/mobile money transfers
- **dtone API**: Mobile payment solutions worldwide
- **Momo API**: Mobile money transfers for Africa
- **ValueFirst**: Airtime and mobile services

### Option 3: Payment Integration First
- Integrate Stripe/PayPal for reward payouts
- Users can redeem points for cash instead of airtime
- Convert to airtime later when Reloadly becomes available

### Option 4: Gift Card Rewards
- Amazon gift cards (available globally)
- Google Play/App Store credits
- Local retailer gift cards by region

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 (Current): Complete Core Features
- Keep existing rewards UI and points system
- Use placeholder rewards tracking
- Focus on user engagement and app completion

### Phase 2 (Post-Deployment): Real Rewards Integration
- Deploy app and secure custom domain
- Register with preferred airtime provider
- Implement real rewards API integration
- Add payout verification and compliance features

### Phase 3 (Scale): Multi-Provider Support
- Support multiple reward types (airtime, cash, gift cards)
- Regional optimization for different markets
- Advanced fraud prevention and user verification

## Next Steps
1. Complete app development with existing rewards UI
2. Deploy to production
3. Secure business domain and credentials
4. Choose and integrate airtime provider
5. Launch real rewards program

## Technical Notes
- Current rewards system is fully functional UI-wise
- Database schema supports real transactions
- Easy to swap placeholder logic for real API calls
- User data structure ready for verification requirements
