- **Database**: Drizzle Kit manages schema migrations

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Uses Vite dev server with Express middleware
- **Production**: Serves static files from Express with built React app

- **`shared/`**: Common TypeScript types and schemas
- **`migrations/`**: Database migration files

The application uses a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript configuration and path aliases for clean imports across frontend and backend code.
